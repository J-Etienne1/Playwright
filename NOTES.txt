:::HOW TO RUN TESTS:::
npx playwright test                                         | runs all test on all broswers in headless mode in the test folder

npx playwright show-report                                  | shows report of tests

npx playwright test --workers 3                             | runs with 3 workers in parallel

npx playwright test filename.js                             | runs a specific test file

npx playwright test filename.spec.js filename.spec.js       | runs multiple specific test files

npx playwright test filename1 filename2                     | shorthand of the previous command

npx playwright test -g "check title"                        | runs test with the title eg npx playwright test -g "has title"
test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');

npx playwright test --project=chromium                      | runs test on a specific browser

npx playwright test --headed                                | runs test in headed mode

npx playwright test --debug                                 | debug test

npx playwright test filename.spec.js --debug                | debug a specific test file

npx playwright test filename.spec.js:21 --debug             | debug starting from a specific line, line should be the start of a test eg
test('has title', async ({ page }) => {
  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');
starts on line 4 






:::HOW TO CREATE TESTS:::
1. Create a new file in the tests folder

2. File must have the ext .spec.js

3. Add module "playwright/test" -  modules live in nodes_modules folder look for @playwright folder we need scripts from here
   To add them, use an import in your test file using 
   require("playwright/test")
4. Also need the test.js & expect.js scripts so add them to your test file
   instead of including evertyhing in the lib folder can use var OR const to declare them in the test file
   const{test, expect}= require('@playwright/test');


5. created demo folder in tests with the file hello.js and created functions and exposed them to be used in the test my_first_test/.spec.js
   to run them used
   node .\tests\my_first_test.spec.js

6. Playwright Test provides a test function to declare and expect function to write assertions

7. create a test block - test(title, function)
test('My first test', () => {
    
})


8. the page paramater allows us access webpages

9. the async before a function makes a function return a promise

9. the await keyword before the function makes the function wait a promise
